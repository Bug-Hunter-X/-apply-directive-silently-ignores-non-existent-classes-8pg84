The solution is to double-check your class names for typos and ensure the class exists in your Tailwind configuration.  A more robust approach involves better tooling, though that is not demonstrated in this simplified example.

Here is a corrected version of `bug.html`:
```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 my-4"></div>
```
This assumes `my-4` is a valid margin class in your Tailwind setup.
